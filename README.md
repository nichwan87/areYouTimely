# areYouTimely

Time, date and day scheduler for the busy people
Allows users to input schedules for the day ahead of them - and then be prompted if the scheduled task is current, prior or in the future.

## Usage

Find the release at (https://nichwan87.github.io/areYouTimely/)

Intended usage is for a simple schedule to be planned for the current day and actioned.

When a user clicks in the text field to the right of the time, then text can be added to notate a scheduled event.

When a user clicks the floppy button (save), text is saved.

As the user completes tasks, the two glass button (done) can be activated - this will change the colour of the time, glass button and cross out the event.

Any tasks in the past will be opaque and dark grey.

Current tasks will be blue

Future tasks will be slightly opaque and a meadow colour.

Current tasks will be in a larger text box than the others.

Any tasks that are due in the next hour will be coloured red and a green dashed border will surround them.

Any overflow can be seen with the internal scroll functions or by expanding the boxes.

Users may split their tasks between the segmented hour blocks (i.e. 7:00AM and 7.30AM). When the start of the hour is met (i.e. it is currently 7:00AM), the two 30 minute blocks will be highlighted in blue.

## Support
Please contact nichwan_is@hotmail.com for any support related enquiries.

## Roadmap
Additional desired features will be a calender to pick dates from (to save prior and future schedules) as well as a database to save the information to and then re-draw it out in either schedule or report formats.
